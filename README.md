Effcient On-the-Fly Model Checking for LTL and CTL★
=======

This repository contains a functional implementation in Haskell of the algorithms included in the article
_Effcient On-the-Fly Model Checking for CTL★_.

It's important to say this method works without Büchi automatons.
In the words of the authors:

> In this paper we present an on-the-fly algorithm for checking finite-state Kripke structures against CTL★ formulas.

> Our routine constructs the state space of the system under consideration in a need-driven fashion and will therefore perform better in practice.
